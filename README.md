# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project showcases a personalized **Movie Recommendation System** built on the **MovieLens dataset**. It leverages two advanced recommendation approaches: **User-Based Recommendations** using **Deep Factorization Machine** and **Item-Based Recommendations** using **Cosine Similarity**. The system also features an interactive dashboard built with **Dash** and **Plotly** for a smooth user experience.

## Key Features
- **User-Based Recommendations**: Using **Deep Factorization Machine** to understand complex user-item interactions for highly personalized movie recommendations.
- **Item-Based Recommendations**: Utilizing **Cosine Similarity** to suggest movies based on those the user has already liked, leveraging ratings and genres.
- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - **User Page**: View personalized movie-watching history and get custom recommendations.
  - **Movie Page**: Get movie recommendations based on the title selected, filtered by ratings or genres.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Dash** & **Plotly**: For building an interactive, user-friendly dashboard.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models such as **Cosine Similarity**.
- **DeepCTR**: For the **Deep Factorization Machine** model.
- **MovieLens Dataset**: Used for training and testing the recommendation system.


## Usage

1. **User Page**: Select your User ID to view your movie-watching history and get personalized recommendations based on your viewing habits.
2. **Movie Page**: Enter a movie title to get recommendations based on movie ratings or genre similarity.

## Future Improvements
- Add **real-time recommendations** based on live user interactions.
- Incorporate **additional user demographic data** to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Implement **hybrid recommendation models** combining both user and item features.

## Conclusion
This Movie Recommendation System demonstrates the power of combining **User-Based** and **Item-Based** recommendation approaches to deliver personalized movie suggestions. Through **Deep Factorization Machines** and **Cosine Similarity**, the system captures complex user-item relationships and item similarities. The interactive dashboard, built using **Dash** and **Plotly**, offers users an intuitive and engaging interface to explore their recommendations.

Moving forward, this project provides a strong foundation for implementing more advanced features, such as real-time recommendations and hybrid models that leverage both user preferences and item attributes.
